    "You are asked to cut off all the trees in a forest for a golf event. The forest is represented as an m x n matrix. In this matrix:\n",

    "0 means the cell cannot be walked through.\n",
    "1 represents an empty cell that can be walked through.\n",
    "A number greater than 1 represents a tree in a cell that can be walked through, and this number is the tree's height.\n",

    "You must cut off the trees in order from shortest to tallest. When you cut off a tree, the value at its cell becomes 1 (an empty cell).\n",
