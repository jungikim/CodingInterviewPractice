    "Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine.\n",
    "Users may input a sentence (at least one word and end with a special character'#').\n",
    "Foreach character they type except '#', you need to return the top 3 historical hot sentences\n",
    "that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed. Here are the specific rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.\n",
    "2. The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one).\n",
    "   If several sentences have the same degree of hot, you need to use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).\n",
    "3. If less than 3 hot sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.\n",
    "4. When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to implement the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times):\n",
    "   This is the constructor.\n",
    "   The input ishistorical data.\n",
    "   Sentencesis a string array consists of previously typed sentences.\n",
    "   Times is the corresponding times a sentence has been typed. Your system should record these historical data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Now, the user wants to input a new sentence.\n",
    "The following function will provide the next character the user types:\n",
    "\n",
    "List<String> input(char c):\n",
    "   The inputcis the next character typed by the user.\n",
    "   The character will only be lower-case letters ('a'to'z'), blank space (' ') or a special character ('#').\n",
    "   Also, the previously typed sentence should be recorded in your system.\n",
    "   The output will be thetop 3historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "1. The input sentence will always start with a letter and end with '#', and only one blank space will exist between two words.\n",
    "2. The number of complete sentences that to be searched won't exceed 100.\n",
    "   The length of each sentence including those in the historical data won't exceed 100.\n",
    "3. Please use double-quote instead of single-quote when you write test cases even for a character input.\n",
    "4. Please remember to RESET your class variables declared in class AutocompleteSystem, as static/class variables are\n",
    "   persisted across multiple test cases . Please see here for more details.\n",
